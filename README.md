PSU-EC314-Syllabus
==================

This is an engineering economics course that is tuned to the Portland State University University Studies requirements and has a much lower math requirement than other engineering economics courses and includes slightly more accounting material than you would see elsewhere.  

The course has four main tent pole ideas: 
+ Basic accounting transactions
+ Time value of money calculations with factor notation, which is used on the PE and FE exam.
+ Investment Decision Criteria such as PW, AW and IRR.
+ Cash flow projections with income and cash flow statements.

There is a branch for each term.  Just find the one you want in the dropdown list.  There should be a PDF for each branch.  That will be the most readable version of the syllabus. 

Please feel free to fork for your own class.
