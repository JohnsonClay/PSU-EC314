PSU-EC314-Syllabus
==================

This is an engineering economics course that is tuned to the Portland State University University Studies requirements and has a much lower math requirement than other engineering economics courses.

There is a branch for each term.  Just find the one you want in the dropdown list.  There should be a PDF for each branch.  That will be the most readable version of the syllabus. 

Please feel free to fork for your own class.
