## Goals

+ Enough background so non-accountants have some idea of what accountants do.
+ A shared language of terms for when we work together.
+ Appreciation that we all have our parts
    + Engineers tend to stick with cost estimation
    + Economists tend to stick with revenue estimation
    + Accounting types often do the rest with a focus on tax
+ Set you up for cash flow forecasts later in the course.
    + Frequent job activity
    + Also needed for business loans and business plans
    
Enough knowledge to read the basic documents but not enough to create them.

## Warnings

+ Will feel like drinking from firehouse if you have no background but same pace as intro accounting.
+ Shortcuts/simplifications to get set up for cash flow forecasts.
    + Barrier between income statement and balance sheet. Revenue and expenses not immediately reflected.
    + Forget about contra accounts.
    + Simplification of the connection between balance sheet and cash flow statement.
        + All asset purchases, even inventory, are cash from investments.
        + All borrowing and lending, even accounts receivable/payable, are cash from finance.
    
## Focus on Financial Accounting

+ Financial accounting focuses on the preparation of documents for public consumption.
    + Balance sheet (Assets, Liabilities and Owner Equity)
    + Income statement (Revenue and Expenses)
    + Cash Flow statement (Inflows and Outflows of Cash)
+ There are other accounting areas
    + Audit (Makes sure people follow the rules and are not misstating things.)
    + Cost or Managerial (Cost benefit, volume studies, accounting approach to much of this class.)
    + Forensic (Get an attorney)
    + Fund and Governmental (Where money is separated and has strings)
    + Tax (Often Different Rules)

## What is in the three documents?

This is mostly a discussion of nouns.  We will add verbs and get *transactions* later.

## Connections between the documents

+ Think about the cash flow statement as the consequences of balance sheet and net income changes.
+ Things that change net income changes cash from operations
+ Asset purchases and sales change cash from investments.
+ Borrowing, lending and owner equity changes are reflected in cash from finance.

## How to Drill and Kill the transactions

+ Resources 
    + Wiki page http://ec314-pdx-edu.wikidot.com/q1:accounting
    + There are a small number of transactions I ask about.  Thirteen are listed but there are really only eight.
    + Bottom of the page has a link to past examples (https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B3ilawp4z7olelZTWE5lNHJIV0E)
    + And videos of my explaining things (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?p=PL9B50CBC168EDAFC7)

+ Learn the transactions first.  Flash cards work well.
+ Then practice on categorizing actual transactions into the 8 that you know. Use the videos and past examples for this


## Flashcards

One side has a transaction like "Buy an asset"

The reverse has something like this.


\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|p{.75 in} |p{.75 in}|  p{.75 in}|}
\hline

&$\uparrow \downarrow$ &\\
&&\\
\hline
Expense & Liabilities & Investments\\
&&$\downarrow$\\
