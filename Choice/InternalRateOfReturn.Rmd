## Goals

+ Present a few ways of calculating internal rate of return with cautions.
+ Explain why the IRR criteria is different for loans and investments.
+ Explain the quirks of the exclusive choice procedure.


## What is Internal Rate of Return?

It is an interest rate such that the present worth of an asset is zero.

+ PW is with known $i$.  IRR has a known PW, zero, and you solve for $i$. 
+ It is "an" because multiple internal rates of return are fairly common.

## The Problem

$$PW = A_0 + \frac{A_1}{(1+i)} + \frac{A_2}{(1+i)^2} + \dots +  \frac{A_N}{(1+i)^N}$$

+ Should look like a polynomial
+ Internal rates of return are the roots of this polynomial
+ You can have more than one root.

## Example One Root
$$PW = -10 + \frac{15}{(1+i)^3}$$
```{r, fig.height=5}
curve(-10 + 15/(1+x)^3, from = 0, to = 1)
curve(x*0, from = 0, to = 1, add = TRUE)
```

Note the single root at $\left( \frac{15}{10}     \right)^{\frac{1}{3}} -1 = `r (15/10)^(1/3) - 1`$

## Easy Calculation

Simple case is when you have a value for $A_0$ and then one value in another time period, $A_N$

$$\begin{split}PW = 0 &= A_0 + \frac{A_N}{(1+i)^N}\\
\Rightarrow -A_0 &=\frac{A_N}{(1+i)^N}\\
\Rightarrow i &= \left(  \frac{-A_N}{A_0} \right)^{\frac{1}{N}} -1
\end{split}$$

## Multiple Roots

Descartes' rule of signs:  The number of positive real roots is less than or equal to the number of sign changes in the coefficients of the polynomial.

Year| A | B |
----|---|---|
0   | -10 | -10 |
1   |10 |10  |
2   |10  |-5 | 

+ A Has only one sign change and therefore at most one IRR, i.e., one positive real root.
+ B has two sign changes and therefore *at most* two positive IRRs, i.e, two positive real roots.

## Multiple IRRs
This has IRRs at 10%, 30% and 50%
```{r , fig.height=5}

curve(-1000 + 3900/(1 + x) - 5030/(1 + x)^2 + 2145/(1 + x)^3, 0, .6, ylab = "PW", xlab="i"  )
curve(0 * x, 0, .6, add = TRUE)
```

+ This is -1000, 3900, -5030, 2145
+ Note three  sign changes.

## At Most ...


```{r , fig.height=5}

curve(-1002 + 3900/(1 + x) - 5030/(1 + x)^2 + 2145/(1 + x)^3, 0, .6, ylab = "PW", xlab="i"  )
curve(0 * x, 0, .6, add = TRUE)
```

+ This is -100*2*, 3900, -5030, 2145
+ Only one root.

## Calculating IRR

+ Your calculator will have:
    + IRR function: Works but you need to give it a starting value if there is more than one root.
    + solve: Which is symbolic algebra and is gimped and limits number of cash flows.
    + nsolve: Similar to IRR with a starting value requirement.
+ Spreadsheets
    + IRR( range, [estimated_irr] )
    + Numerical root finder that requires starting value if you have more than one root.

## Try a few

```{r}
library(polynom)


OneIRR <-function(A){
  polyform <- as.function(polynomial(A))
  d <- uniroot(function(x) polyform(x), interval = c(0, 1))$root
  (1-d)/d
}

#OneIRR(c(-10,0,0,15))

```


Year| A | B | C
----|---|---|---
0   | -10 | 10 |-10
1   |0 |0  |7
2   |15  |-15 |7 



## How did you do?


Year| A | B | C
----|---|---|---
0   | -10 | 10 |-10
1   |0 |0  |7
2   |15  |-15 |7 
IRR|`r OneIRR(c(-10,0,15))`| `r OneIRR(c(10,0,-15))`| `r OneIRR(c(-10,7,7))`


+ It should not be a shock that A and B give the same result.
+ BTW I used a numerical solver for this.
+ Lets look at shapes starting with A

## Cost 10 Now and Gives 15 in time 2

```{r , fig.height=5}

curve(-10 + 15/(1 + x)^2 , 0, .6, ylab = "PW", xlab="i"  )
curve(0 * x, 0, .6, add = TRUE)
```

+ PW is zero at `r OneIRR(c(-10,0,15))`.
+ Is investment shaped, costs now and benefits later.
+ If MARR is less than IRR, PW>0 and a good asset.
+ If MARR is greater than IRR, PW<0 and not good.


## Gives 10 Now and Costs 15 in time 2

```{r , fig.height=5}

curve(10 - 15/(1 + x)^2 , 0, .6, ylab = "PW", xlab="i"  )
curve(0 * x, 0, .6, add = TRUE)
```

+ PW is zero at `r OneIRR(c(10,0,-15))`.
+ Is loan shaped, benefits now and costs later.
+ If MARR is less than IRR, PW>0 and a bad asset.
+ If MARR is greater than IRR, PW<0 and good asset.


## Summary Unconstrained Choice Criteria

+ If the asset has a single root...
    + and is an investment, buy if $IRR \geq MARR$
    + and is a loan, buy it if $MARR \geq IRR$
+ In words
    + Buy assets with high returns.
    + Take out loans with low rates.
    
## What if there is more than one IRR?

```{r , fig.height=5}

curve(-1000 + 3900/(1 + x) - 5030/(1 + x)^2 + 2145/(1 + x)^3, 0, .6, ylab = "PW", xlab="i"  )
curve(0 * x, 0, .6, add = TRUE)
```

+ It depends on the client
+ Often the clients that ask for IRR don't understand that there can be more than one root.
+ Had a student with real problem that had 100 IRRs.
+ One of my first consulting oopses was about IRR.

## True Story

+ Was presenting and asset had two roots.
+ This guy, George, questioned my competence because he thought it wasn't possible.
+ The Chief Economist taught me a more gentle way of treating fools...you lie.  

A lie of omission, not commission.

## An Approach

+ Feel out your client.  If they get that there can be more than one IRR, tell them.
+ If they don't
    + Find out the range for the likely MARR.
    + Only tell them the IRR that leads them to the correct decision and is  reasonably conservative.
+ If they are a long-term client, you can introduce the idea later.
    + Consulting is  a tough teaching gig.
    + Just because everyone nods, doesn't mean they get it.  Lots off emperors new clothes effects.

## Example: MARR<10\%

```{r , fig.height=5}

curve(-1000 + 3900/(1 + x) - 5030/(1 + x)^2 + 2145/(1 + x)^3, 0, .6, ylab = "PW", xlab="i"  )
curve(0 * x, 0, .6, add = TRUE)
```

+ Notice that the PW > 0 and they should buy it.
+ Tell them 10%
    + Smallest number that
    + Leads them to correct conclusion, "buy",  because IRR>MARR
    
## Example: 30%>MARR>10\%

```{r , fig.height=5}

curve(-1000 + 3900/(1 + x) - 5030/(1 + x)^2 + 2145/(1 + x)^3, 0, .6, ylab = "PW", xlab="i"  )
curve(0 * x, 0, .6, add = TRUE)
```

+ Notice that the PW < 0 and they should NOT buy it.
+ Tell them 10%
    + Smallest number that
    + Leads them to correct conclusion, "Don't Buy", because IRR<MARR    
    
    
## Example: 50%>MARR>30\%

```{r , fig.height=5}

curve(-1000 + 3900/(1 + x) - 5030/(1 + x)^2 + 2145/(1 + x)^3, 0, .6, ylab = "PW", xlab="i"  )
curve(0 * x, 0, .6, add = TRUE)
```

+ Notice that the PW > 0 and they should  buy it.
+ Tell them 50%
    + Smallest number that
    + Leads them to correct conclusion, "Buy", because IRR>MARR    

    
## Exclusive Choice

+ Unconstrained choice  IRR is pretty common.
+ Exclusive choice is not
    + Never saw it in the real world.
    + Only on the  PE exam.
+ Promise me you will never use this in the real world.

## Promise Me

I'm serious, never use this.

## Exclusive Choice IRR

+ Historical algorithm
+ Great for when computation was expensive and decision making was cheap.
+ Economized on computation.  You did it once.
+ After you had that data you could play "What-if" with the MARR as long as you wanted.

## Don't pick asset with largest IRR

Year| A | B |
----|---|---|
0   | -1 | -1000 |
1   |2 |1110  |
IRR|`r 2/1 -1`| `r 1110/1000 -1`|

A has the highest IRR but if MARR is moderate, you want B.

## The Procedure

This procedure has a lot of caveats

+ All assets are investments.
+ All assets have a single IRR
+ All incremental IRRs are unique
+ Only $A_0<0$.  No costs after time zero.

## Incremental IRR

+ Incremental IRR is the internal rate of return of the difference between two cash flows.
+ Often though of as the IRR of upgrading to another asset.
+ Example:

Year| A | B |B-A|
----|---|---|---|
0   | -1 | -1000 |-999|
1   |2 |1110  |1108|
IRR|   |   |`r 1108/999 -1`|

$$IRR(B-A)\neq IRR(B) - IRR(A)$$

## Common Problem with Incremental IRRs

Year| A | B |B-A|
----|---|---|---|
0   | -1 |-3|-2|
1   |0    |6 | 6|
2   |2   |  0 | -2  |

+ Notice that both A and B have one sign change
+ Notice that B-A has two sign changes.  
    + Not two IRRs but the threat is there.
    + This causes problems for the algorithm. 


## The Algorithm

+ Order assets from smallest initial investment to largest.
+ Eliminate all assets with IRR<MARR.
+ Set asset with smallest initial investment as Best Candidate (BC)
+ While assets remain:
    + Set next asset as Challenger (C)
    + If Incremental IRR $\geq$ MARR, Eliminate BC and set C as BC.
    + Else, Eliminate C.
+ Remaining Asset is the best.

## Commentary on the Algorithm
+ Order assets from smallest initial investment to largest.
    + Done so incremental IRRs are all interpreted as investments and you can use IRR>MARR as a test.
+ Eliminate all assets with IRR<MARR.
    + Assets that are not acceptable can't be the best.

## Commentary (Con't)

+ Set asset with smallest initial investment as Best Candidate (BC)
+ While assets remain:
    + Set next asset as Challenger (C)
    
This initializes a loop and creates a series  of tournaments.
    
+ If Incremental IRR $\geq$ MARR, Eliminate BC and set C as BC.
+ Else, Eliminate C.

The uniqueness of IRRs and the ordering by initial investment, coupled with only allowing costs in period zero, allows the easy comparison.

## Example with Computation of All Values

Year| A | B |C  |
----|---|---|---|
0   | -1| -3|-7 |
1   |0  |0  |0  | 
2   | 2  |  5 | 10  |

+ Compute IRRs for all assets.
+ Compute incremental IRRs for all pairs of assets.
+ Use data to follow the algorithm

## IRRs

```{r}
IRRA <- (2/1)^(1/2) - 1
IRRB <- (5/3)^(1/2) - 1
IRRC <- (10/7)^(1/2) - 1
```


Year| A | B |C  |
----|---|---|---|
0   | -1| -3|-7 |
1   |0  |0  |0  | 
2   | 2  |  5 | 10  |
IRR |`r IRRA`| `r IRRB`| `r IRRC`|

Remember $IRR = \left( \frac{-A_N}{A_0} \right)^ {\frac{1}{N}} - 1$ when you only have values in time zero and one other time period.


Try computing IRR(B-A) and IRR(C-A).

 
## Incremental IRRs

```{r}
AB <- (3/2)^(1/2) - 1
AC <- (8/6)^(1/2) - 1
BC <- (5/4)^(1/2) - 1

```

Year| A | B |B-A  |
----|---|---|---|
0   | -1| -3| -2 |
1   |0  |0  |0  | 
2   | 2  |  5 | 3  |
IRR |`r IRRA`| `r IRRB`| `r AB`|


Year| A | C |C-A  |
----|---|---|---|
0   | -1| -7|-6 |
1   |0  |0  |0  | 
2   | 2  |  10 | 8  |
IRR |`r IRRA`| `r IRRC`| `r AC`|

Try IRR(C-B)

## Incremental IRRs (Con't)


Year| B | C |C-B  |
----|---|---|---|
0   | -3| -7|-4 |
1   |0  |0  |0  | 
2   | 5  |  10 | 5  |
IRR |`r IRRB`| `r IRRC`| `r BC`|


## Summary of Data

Asset | IRR     | A   | B     |   C   |
----  |----     |---- |-----  |-----  |
A     |`r IRRA` |     |`r AB` |`r AC` |
B     |`r IRRB` |     |       |`r BC` |
C     |`r IRRC` |     |       |       |

The other half of the incremental IRR matrix is often not given because it is symmetric.

Find the best asset when the MARR is 15%.

## MARR of 15%

Asset | IRR     | A   | B     |   C   |
----  |----     |---- |-----  |-----  |
A     |`r IRRA` |     |`r AB` |`r AC` |
B     |`r IRRB` |     |       |`r BC` |
C     |`r IRRC` |     |       |       |

+ Order assets as A, B ,C because initial costs are 1, 3, and 7 respectively.
+ No assets have IRRs less than MARR
+ A is BC and B is first challenger.
    + IRR(B-A) = `r AB` > MARR, toss A and set B as BC.
    + IRR(C-B) = `r BC` < MARR, toss C.

B is the best asset at 15%.
