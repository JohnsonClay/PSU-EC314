<!-- This is just a rough in -->

## Goals

+ Be able to make a *financial* argument for the choice of one asset over another.
+ Be able to use all the criteria depending on client needs.
+ Do some calculator practice.


## Convergent Development

+ Both Engineering and Economics developed Cost/Benefit analysis ideas in parallel.
+ Many similarities but ...
    + Engineers focus on the money alone.
    + Economists focus on welfare, money plus opportunity costs.
+ The side-effect is a lot of misunderstandings.

## Things you need to know to make a choice

+ The kind of choice (Environment), e.g., exclusive choice
+ The assets
+ The minimum acceptable rate of return (MARR), an interest rate
+ The planning horizon
+ The prefered criteria

## Two Envioronments

## How we describe assets

## Synthetic Assets

## The Three + One Tests

## Basic, no calculation, ideas

This is from the pre-test

Year| A | B | C
----|---|---|---
0   | 0 | 0 |0
1   |10 |0  |0
2   |0  |10 |20 

+ More in the same time period is better, $C \succ B$
+ Same amount sooner is better, $A \succ B$
+ Anything other than these two pure cases requires some computation.


## Simple Payback

+ Warning
    + This one is not consistent with the others and does not always give the same choice.
    + In common use as a pre-test

## Why Simple Payback Fails

##
## Using exclusive choice for counts
