What is the per-period cost of the car when the MARR is 10%?\n\n$$10K(A|P, i = 10\\%, 5) = `r Acc(agivenp(10, .1, 5))`K$$\n\n+ The purchase price -- now -- is a present worth.\n+ Notice that it is not $\\frac{10K}{5}$. It does take into account that you paid for the car in time zero.\n\n## The AW Criteria\n\n+ Annual Worth\n    + Per-period costs and benefits ($)\n    + Unconstrained: If $AW \\geq 0$ get it.\n    + Exclusive: If assets have the same life, choose asset with largest AW.\n    \n## Unconstrained Choice\n\nIf $AW \\geq 0$ get it.\n\n$$AW(Asset) = PW(Asset)(A|P,i,Life~of~Asset)$$\n\n+ Note that $(A|P,i,Life~of~Asset)$ is always positive.\n+ That means $PW \\geq 0 \\Rightarrow AW \\geq 0$\n\n\n## Exclusive Choice\n\nIf assets have the same life, choose asset with largest AW.\n\n+ The \"If\" is critical\n+ Example why\n\nYear| A | B |\n----|---|---|\n0   | 0 | 0 |\n1   |10 |9  |\n2   |  |9  |\n3   | |9  |\n4   | |9  |\n5   | |9  |\nAW | 10 | 9|  \n\n+ With moderate MARR, B is better but has lower AW.\n\n## The If\n\n+ It is less restrictive than you think and often useful.\n+ You can construct assets from other assets.\n+ Example {Car, Kayak Rack, Kayaks}\n    + Doesn't make sense to get a rack without a car or kayaks.\n    + Re-frame as exclusive choice: \n        + A = {Car}\n        + B = {Car, Kayaks}\n        + C = {Car, Rack, Kayaks}\n\n## How this helps with repeated purchases\n\n+ Remember the Roof Example?\n    + Metal Roof (Like the old one but 'done correctly') would last 40 years and cost $1.5M.\n    + PVC Roof would last 20 years and cost 800K to install.  It also requires 15K in additional inspection and maintenance in years 16-20.\n+ These have unequal lives but you can use AW by constructing a new asset\n    + A = {Metal now}\n    + B = {PVC now, PVC in 20 years}\n    \n## The Metal Roof\n\nWhat is the levelized cost of the $1.5M metal roof when the MARR is 10%?\n\n## Answer\n\n$$1500K(A|P, i = .1, 40) = `r Acc(agivenp(1500, .1, 40))`K$$\n\nInterpret this as the annual cost of roofing services.\n\n## The PVC Roof\n\nWhat is the levelized cost of the the two PVC roofs when the MARR is 10%?\n\nPW of the first roof is:\n$$PW(PVC) = 800K + \\frac{15K(P|A, i = .1, 5)}{(1+.1)^{15}} = `r Acc(800 + pgivena(15, .1, 5)/(1.1^15))`K$$\n\n## Trick Question\n\nThe answer is the same if you make the calculation with two roofs or one.\n\n```{r}\nPW1 <- 800 + pgivena(15, .1, 5)/(1.1^15)\nAW1 <- agivenp(PW1, .1, 20)\nPW2 <- PW1 + PW1/1.1^20\nAW2 <- agivenp(PW2, .1, 40)\n\n```\n\n\n+ One Roof: $ `r Acc(PW1)`K (A|P, i = 10\\%, 20) = `r Acc(AW1)`K$\n+ Two Roofs:\n    + $PW(PVC| 40 Years) = `r Acc(PW1)`K + \\frac{`r Acc(PW1)`K}{1.1^{20}} = `r Acc(PW2)`K$\n    + $AW(PVC| 40 Years) = `r Acc(PW2)`K (A|P, i = 10\\%, 40) = `r Acc(AW2)`K$\n    \n    \n\nThis is the computational advantage of AW in the case of repeated purchases.\n\n## Repeated Purchases\n\n+ AW provides a computational shortcut when there are repeated purchases.\n    + If you buy one asset and then replace it with an identical one.\n    + Like replacing lamps in fixtures.\n+ Only works if the asset lives are factors of the planning horizon.\n+ I usually call these conforming assets.\n+ Example:  \n    + Planning horizon of 12 years.\n    + Options have lives of 3, 4, 2, and 6 years.\n    \n## Repeated Purchases (Con't)\n\nAs long as assets are factors of the planning horizon:\n\n$$AW(Asset | Single) = AW (Asset| Repeated)$$\n\n## The planning horizon\n\nOften times you are not given an explicit planning horizon.\n\n+ I've done this to you with abstract assets.  The planning horizon is implicitly the life of the longest lived asset.\n+ Planning horizon is 2 years.\n    \nYear| A | B | \n----|---|---|\n0   | 0 | 0 |\n1   |10 |0  |\n2   |0  |10 |\n\n## Common Practice\n\n+ Common practice is to set the planning horizon equal to the least common multiple of the asset lives.\n    + Asset lives of 2, 3 and 4 years\n    + Planning horizon of 12.\n+ Same as result as infinite horizon without the limits.\n\n## Comments on Common Practice\n\n+ The planning horizon should be reasonable.\n+ Backyard Aquaculture Story:\n    + Two potential pumps: 3 and 4 year pumps\n    + Planning horizon 12 years.\n    + If 8 and 9 years?  I'm not living another 72 years.\n+ Rounding a few years on asset lives often does not matter much for long-lived investments.\n    + (P|A, i = 1., 100) = `r pgivena(1, .1, 100)`\n    + (P|A, i = 1., 101) = `r pgivena(1, .1, 101)`\n+ Do the math anyway, you are billing, but it probably won't change the decision.\n\n## Common Practice  for Non-conforming Assets\n\n+ Two general options:\n    + Repeat purchases followed by an equipment lease for the remaining time.\n    + Repeat purchases followed by salvage/sale of asset before end of life.\n+ Calculate PW based on these patterns and convert to AW.\n+ Example:  5 Year asset and 12 year planning horizon\n    + Lease: $PW = PW(Asset) + \\frac{PW(Asset)}{(1 +i)^{5} } + \\frac{Lease(P|A, i, 2)}{(1+i)^{10}}$\n    + Salvage: $PW = PW(Asset) + \\frac{PW(Asset)}{(1 +i)^{5} } + \\frac{PW(Asset)}{(1 +i)^{10} } +\n    \\frac{Salvage}{(1+i)^{12}}$\n    \n## Backyard Aquaculture\n\nThe idea was to add Tilapia to the composting and garden cycle. MARR of 10%\n\n+ Choice of two pumps to keep water moving.\n    + Pump 1: 7 year life, $100.\n    + Pump 2: 5 year life, $75.\n    \n+ Calculate the AW\n+ Choose the best asset to provide this service.\n\n## Answer\n\n+ Note implied planning horizon is 35 years.\n+ AW Calculations\n    + $AW(Pump 1) = 100 (A|P, i = .1, 7) = `r Acc(agivenp(100, .1, 7))`\n    + $AW(Pump 2) = 75 (A|P, i = .1, 5) = `r Acc(agivenp(75, .1, 5))`\n    \n+ Interpretation\n    + Pump 1 provides pumping services at a cost of \\$`r Acc(agivenp(100, .1, 7))` per year.\n    + Pump 2 provides pumping services at a cost of \\$`r Acc(agivenp(75, .1, 5))` per year.\n\n\nNotice that Pump 2 provides pumping services at the lowest cost.\n\n## You Can Do PW too\n\nPW Calculations for 35 Year planning horizon.\n\n+ $PW(Pump~1| 35 Years) = 100 + \\frac{100}{1.1^{7}}+ \\frac{100}{1.1^{14}}+ \\frac{100}{1.1^{21}} + \\frac{100}{1.1^{28}} = `r Acc(100 + 100/1.1^7+ 100/1.1^14+ 100/1.1^21+ 100/1.1^28)`$\n+ Will use the time compression trick.\n```{r}\nR5 <- round((1.1)^5-1,4)\n```\n    + Effective 5-year rate: $(1+\\frac{.1}{1})^5 -1 = `r R5`$\n\n    + $PW(Pump~2| 35 Years) = 75 + \\frac{75(P|A, i = `r R5`, 6)}{(1+ `r R5`)} = `r Acc(75 + pgivena(75, R5, 6))`$\n    \n    \nNotice that Pump 2 provides pumping services at the lowest cost.\n\n\n## Summary\n\n+ AW and PW give consistent choice but by different means.\n+ AW provides a computational advantage when asset lives are factors of planning horizon.\n+ Clients often find AW, per-period costs and benefits, easier to interpret than PW, life-cycle costs and benefits.\n\n\n",
