Opportunity cost means what you give up.\n\n+ If investment is funded with a loan, then the opportunity cost is a larger loan at the loan rate.  MARR can be the loan rate.\n+ If the investment is funded out of retained earnings, then the opportunity cost is your usual rate of return on investments, i.e., the return on assets (Usually modified)\n+ Frequently there is some reference interest rate in use:\n    + Mortgage rate\n    + State bond rate\n    + Growth rate in real GDP.\n    \n## Sometimes\n\nYou have to hold the client's hand and guide them through a process of finding the right real (abstracting out inflation) interest rate and then adding in inflation forecasts.  \n    \n$$Nominal = Real + Inflation + (Real)(Inflation)$$    \n    \nSometimes you are told\n\n+ Ask accounting.\n+ There may be a law.\n+ Office of Management and Budget (OMB) publishes what you should use https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/10/2017-00209/discount-rates-for-cost-effectiveness-analysis-of-federal-programs\n+ In this class I will give you the MARR.\n\n## Gotchas\n\n+ If you have constraints, cash flow limitations like the capital budgeting problem, the MARR does not reflect the full opportunity cost.\n+ The shadow cost of the constraint is implicitly in the choice but this confuses people.\n+ Econ/Engineer difference.\n    + Engineers change the procedure to keep present worth calculation easy.\n    + Economists switch to constrained optimization.\n\n## Planning Horizon\n\nThis is how far into the future you need to look.\n\n+ In this class it is mostly implied by the kind of question.\n+ Most important when we are looking at service investments, i.e., when we must provide specific services for a stated number of years.\n+ Can be important in determining which asset is best.\n\nOne of the first questions for many home improvements is, \"How long will you stay in the house?\" Not all improvements get reflected in the sales price.\n\n## Example of planning horizon effects.\n\nLow income property development in Oregon\n\n+ For profit and non-profit partner to develop property.\n+ Tax credits are received for 15 years.\n+ For profit takes the credits and then transfers the property to the non-profit after 15 years.\n+ Non-profit must plan for 60 years of operation.\n\nThree groups:\n\n+ Non-profit: Cares about first cost and 60 years of maintenance costs.\n+ For-profit: Cares about first cost and 15 years of maintenance costs.\n+ Maintenance: Does not care about first costs, only the 60 years of maintenance.\n\n\n## Result\n\n+ Non-profit balances higher first costs and maintenance.\n+ For-profit prefers the lowest first cost of all three groups.\n+ Maintenance prefers the highest first costs so that maintenance costs are lower. \n\nDifferent planning horizon yields different choices.\n\n## The Three Consistent tests (Summary) \n\n\n+ Present Worth\n    + Life-cycle cost and benefits ($)\n    + Unconstrained: If $PW \\geq 0$ get it.\n    + Exclusive: Choose largest PW\n+ Annual Worth\n    + Per-period costs and benefits ($)\n    + Unconstrained: If $AW \\geq 0$ get it.\n    + Exclusive: If assets have the same life, choose asset with largest AW\n+ Internal Rate of Return\n    + Per-period costs *or* benefits (%)\n    + Unconstrained:  If a single IRR exists ...\n        + If investment, get it if $IRR \\geq MARR$.\n        + If loan, get it if $IRR \\leq MARR$.\n    + Exclusive: IRR Procedure (Later in Class)\n\n<!-- Critieria| Description  | Unconstrainted  | Exclusive | Comments -->\n<!-- ----     | ---        |---     |----   | ----         | ---- -->\n<!-- PW| Life-cycle costs and benefits| If $PW \\geq 0$ buy it| Largest PW | Your workhorse -->\n<!-- AW| Per-Period costs and benefits| If $WW \\geq 0$ buy it| If assets have same life, Largest AW | Good for repeated purchases. -->\n<!-- IRR| Per-dollar costs or benefits| If investment and IRR>MARR, buy it.

Silk purse out of a sow's ear\n\nWill not test you on this.\n\n\n## Present Worth Criteria\n\nThe criteria are simple:\n\n  + Unconstrained: If $PW \\geq 0$ get it.\n  + Exclusive: Choose largest PW\n  \n## Intuition on Unconstrained\n\n+ Visualize an account that earns you and charges you the MARR.\n    + If you have spare cash you can put it in and earn interest.\n    + If you need money you can borrow at that rate.  \n+ Every *good* investment must beat out that account.\n\n## Example\n\n+ You have $10 to invest and you can either buy asset A or put the money in the MARR account at 10%.\n+ Notice that the asset gives you more money in period 1, so you would rather do that.\n\nYear| A | MARR | \n----|---|---|\n0   | -10 | -10 |\n1   |15 |11  |\n\nThis is the *future value* point of view, which nobody does because you have to make a bunch of extra calculations and can easily get confused. \n\n## Example (Con't)\n\n+ You have $10 to invest and you can either buy asset A or put the money in the MARR account at 10%.\n+ Notice that the asset gives you more money in period 1, so you would rather do that.\n\nYear| A | MARR | \n----|---|---|\n0   | -10 | -10 |\n1   |15 |11  |\n\n## Now look at the PW\n\n+ Now calculate the PW for each at the MARR\n    + $PW(A) = -10 + \\frac{15}{1+.1}$\n    + $PW(B) = -10 + \\frac{11}{1+.1}$\n\nYear| A | MARR | \n----|---|---|\n0   | -10 | -10 |\n1   |15 |11  |\nPW(10%)| `r -10 + 15/1.1`| 0|\n\n+ Putting money in the MARR account always gives a PW of zero.\n+ You beat or tie the MARR account by having a $PW \\geq 0$\n\n## Exclusive Choice\n\nThe exclusive choice criteria says pick the one with the highest PW.\n\nYear| A | B | \n----|---|---|\n0   | -10 | -15 |\n1   |15 |18  |\nPW(10%) | `r -10 +15/1.1`| `r -15 +18/1.1`|\n\nA has a higher PW and is therefore the best asset of the two.\n\n## Exclusive Choice Intuition\n\nYou have 15 to invest.  You can either buy B alone or buy A for 10 and put the remaining 5 in the MARR account.\n\nYear| A |MARR|  B |\n----|---|---|----|\n0   | -10 | -5| -15 |\n1   |15 |5.5| 18  |\n\nNotice that 15 spent on A and the MARR pays off better than 15 spent on B alone. \n\nAgain, this is the future value point of view.\n    \n+ Notice extra calculations.\n+ Easy to screw up.\n+ Never do this.\n\n## Example Abstract PW problem\n\nWhich asset(s) do you choose when the MARR is 20\\%?\n\nYear| A | B | C\n----|---|---|---\n0   | -10 | -10 |-10\n1   |10 |0  |8\n2   |0  |15 |8 \n\n\n## Answer\n\n\nYear| A | B | C\n----|---|---|---\n0   | -10 | -10 |-10\n1   |10 |0  |8\n2   |0  |15 |8 \nPW(20%)| `r -10 +10/1.2`| `r -10 + 15/1.2^2`| `r -10 + 8/1.2 + 8/1.2^2`\n\n+ \"Which asset\" pick the one with the highest PW.\n+ \"Which assets\" pick the ones with weakly positive PW.\n\n## More Real\n\nYou have the choice of two 100K mortgages:\n\n+ 15-year loan at 3%.\n+ 30-year loan at 4%\n\nWhich do you choose when your savings earns 8% per year compounded monthly? \n\nHints:\n\n+ Find the payments for each loan.\n+ Evaluate the present worth of the payments at your opportunity cost, 8%.\n\n## Solution\n\n+ Payments:\n    + $100K(A|P, i =\\frac{.03}{12} , 15(12)) = `r Acc(agivenp(100000, .03/12, 15*12))`$\n    + $100K(A|P, i = \\frac{.04}{12}, 30 (12)) = `r Acc(agivenp(100000, .04/12, 30*12))`$\n    \n+ PW of payments at $\\frac{.08}{12}$\n    + $`r Acc(agivenp(100000, .03/12, 15*12))` (P|A, i = \\frac{.08}{12} , 15(12)) = `r Acc(pgivena(agivenp(100000, .03/12, 15*12), .08/12, 15*12))`$\n    + $`r Acc(agivenp(100000, .04/12, 30*12))` (P|A, i = \\frac{.08}{12}, 30(12)) = `r Acc(pgivena(agivenp(100000, .04/12, 30*12), .08/12, 30*12))`$\n    \n+ Notice\n    + The 30-year loan is a better deal given your MARR of 8% compounded monthly.\n    + If it was 1% compounded monthly you would prefer the 15-year loan\n        + `r Acc(agivenp(100000, .03/12, 15*12))` (P|A, i = .01/12, 15(12)) = `r Acc(pgivena(agivenp(100000, .03/12, 15*12), .01/12, 15*12))`\n        + `r Acc(agivenp(100000, .04/12, 30*12))` (P|A, i = .01/12, 30(12)) = `r Acc(pgivena(agivenp(100000, .04/12, 30*12), .01/12, 30*12))`\n      \n## Note\n  \n  + IRL We use net cash flow instead of the payment to take into account tax effects.\n  + The MARR changes which choice is best.\n  + The higher the MARR the greater preference for accepting more costs as long as those costs are pushed into the future.\n  \n## Real Life Example\n\nNumbers have been changed to make it simpler and more interesting. IRL the PVC roof won.\n\n+ Parkrose High School needed a new roof https://www.google.com/maps/@45.5527135,-122.5397698,192m/data=!3m1!1e3\n+ Barrel roof leaked.\n+ Two choices:\n    + Metal Roof (Like the old one but 'done correctly') would last 40 years and cost $1.5M.\n    + PVC Roof would last 20 years and cost 800K to install.  It also requires 15K in additional inspection and maintenance in years 16-20.\n+ Note\n    + Not an apples to apples comparison as stated.  You need to provide 40 years of roofing services, with both styles of roof.\n    + Planning horizon is 40 years.\n    + Often called a service investment.  The benefits are the same.  You are just comparing costs.\n\n## Stage 1 Tasks\n\n+ Show a cash flow diagram for the two options.\n+ Show the factor notation representation of the two options.\n\n## Cash Flow Diagram\n\n![](PVCRoof)\n\n## Notes on figure\n\n+ This is cost convention, common with service investments.\n+ If you have down vectors you are in net benefit convention.\n\n## PW\n\n+ $PW(Metal|40 Years) = 1.5M$\n+ Several Ways\n    + Roof 1 + Roof 2\n$$PW(PVC|40 Years) = 800K + \\frac{15K(P|A, i, 5)}{(1+i)^{15}} + \\frac{800K + \\frac{15K(P|A, i, 5)}{(1+i)^{15}}}{(1+i)^{20}}$$\n    + You can also do Install + Maintenance\n    \n## What about the MARR?\n\nIRL there was 1/4% Qualified Zone Academy Bonding  (QZAB) available.\n\n+ Explore the limits of MARR\n+ Suppose MARR is 0%.  \n    + You can then just add cash flows up.\n    + *Metal Roof: 1.5M*\n    + PVC Roof: 800K +800K + 15K x 10\n+ Suppose the MARR limits out to infinity\n    + The future does not matter.

Use this when things get tough.\n+ PW as, \"Life-cycle costs and benefits\" is very confusing for some people.\n+ PW is often not intuitive relative to AW, i.e,  \"Per period costs and benefits.\"\n+ Many clients prefer AW.\n\n",
