# Why Uncertainty and Sensitivity?

## Why?
> - We really don't know
> - Some of our guesses may be critical and senstivity analysis may guide us to spend more time supporting those assumptions.
> - Clients may ask for risk assessments
> - Clients may have other assumptions about critical parameters

## What do you mean "I don't know"?

> - We are way more certain than we should be.
> - Example:
    - Make your best guess at the population of Keyna
    - Give yourself a reasonable upper and lower bound so you are 80% sure the true value is there.
    - Not zero to a billion
    

> - 44.35 M.  
     - One in five of you should be out of bounds.
     - Usually, if honest, more than one in five will be out.
     - If less, Hawthorn Effect

## Some parameters are more critical than others

> - Cost effectivness depends on estimating costs and benefits.
> - Example:  Cost effectivness of an Energy Efficiency improvement
    - Costs, commonly install costs are easy to get.
    - Benefits, due to hours used, are critical.  
> - Low use, not cost effective.  
> - High use, cost effective.

## Client Requests

> - It is not that they don't trust you.
> - Risk plays into setting a MARR.
    - High risk, high MARR
    - Low Risk, low MARR
> - They want to know the probability of success
> - It is part of a portfolio of risks:
    - They want to know how risky
    - They want to know how correlated it is with other risks.
> - They like independent risks
> - They like risks that are negativly correlated with existing risk

## Clients Have Different Assumptions

> - They may disagree with you but you still want to show them that the results are valid
> - There may be actual diversity.  
    - Different costs at different locations.
    - Different experiences in differnt years.
> - You need to do an analysis that covers all that.

# Warnings

## You Have Seen Sensitivity Analysis
> - Recall the PW diagrams we used in learning IRR?
> - Shows how PW changes with changes in MARR. 
    $PW = -10 + \frac{15}{(1+r)}$
    
```{r PWFunction, fig.height=4}

curve(-10 + 15 / (1 + x), 0, 1, ylab = "PW", xlab = "MARR"  )
curve(0 * x, 0,1, add = TRUE)

```


## Other Parameters

There are some parameters that are usually of concern:

> - Initial costs
> - Salvage value
> - Scale

Some are harder than others:

> - Planning horizon
> - Uncertainty about Risks

## Why planning horizon is harder

> - Mostly you assume time is discrete -- not continuous.
> - You need to either change to continuous discounting
    $\frac{1}{e^{N(1+r)}}$ rather than $\frac{1}{(1+r)^N}$
> - Or create an equivelent MARR with smaller compounding periods but equivelent with their nominal statment.

## Example: MARR 10% per year compounded daily

Start with 10% per year MARR and find equivalent annual MARR compounded daily.

$$\left(1 + \frac{r}{365}  \right)^{365} = 1.1$$

$$365 \left[ 1.1^{\frac{1}{365}} -1   \right] = `r 365*(1.1^(1/365) -1)`$$

Allows you to vary time on a smaller time frame.


## Why uncertainty about risks is harder

- Risk is when you know the odds but don't know the outcome.
    - You know that each side of a true die has a 1/6 chance of showing.

- Uncertainty is when you don't know the odds.
    - Uncertain if it is your trick die that rolls a 6 half the time or the true die.
    
> - You end up descibing your beliefs about the probability as a Beta distribution.
    - Hint, you just walked into the land of Bayesian statistics.
    - We will do some Monte Carlo simulations later so you can see what to do.

> - Talk about your sensitivity analysis as about the mean of the present worth rather than the present worth.


# Simple How To
## PW Example
Consider a simple constant series that we can describe the present worth with factor notation:

$$ P = C + A (P|A, i = r, N = n)$$

Lots of parameters to vary:

+ A, the size of the constant benefits. 
+ r, the discount rate
+ n, how long you get payments
+ C, the initial cost

We warned you about r and n so lets vary just A

## PW Figure
r = .1, n = 10, C = -10, $A \in [0,5]$ 

```{r SimplePW, fig.height=4, echo=FALSE}
curve(-10 + x * ((1.1 ^ 10 - 1 ))/(.1 * 1.1 ^ 10), 0, 5, xlab = "A", ylab = "PW")
curve(0 * x, 0, 5, add = TRUE)

PWABreak <- 10 * (.1 * 1.1 ^ 10)/((1.1 ^ 10 - 1 ))
```
BTW PW is zero when A =`r PWABreak`


## What Do You Learn from this?

> - If you are pretty sure that A is not near `r PWABreak`, you are done spending time getting a better estimate of A.
    - Refining you estimate of the parameter with more data, more detailed calculations, more bids, more literature review will not change the decision.
    - Looking for more precision or less uncertainty is a waste of resource.
    
> - If not, then you need to decide if the effort is worth the refinement.  That depends on your other options.
    - Yes, sometimes you do a cost benefit analysis of doing cost benefit analysese.
    

## What Do You Learn from this? (Con't)
> - The client can check on the consequences of their beliefs about A. 
> - Note we still don't know risk, for that we need to know the distribution of our beliefs about A.
    - Is it N(2, .5)?
    - Is it U(1,4)?
    - We will do this later.
    
> - Sensitivity with present worth is easiest of the three.

## AW Example
- Stick with the same cash flow as before with present worth factor notation:

$$ P = C + A (P|A, i = r, N = n)$$

- No more difficult than PW sensitivity analysis unless you want to vary the N.
- Annual worth is just

$$ AW = A + C (A|P,i = r, N = n)$$

## AW Figure

```{r SimpleAW, fig.height=4, echo=FALSE}
curve(x +  -10 * (.1 * 1.1 ^ 10)/((1.1 ^ 10 - 1 )), 0, 5, xlab = "A", ylab = "AW")
curve(0 * x, 0, 5, add = TRUE)

PWABreak <- 10 * (.1 * 1.1 ^ 10)/((1.1 ^ 10 - 1 ))
```


- This is the same information as the PW graph translated into AW.  
- Some clients like to see it this way.

## IRR Example

> - Will use a more complex model for this because IRR can get odd.
> - Changing the parameters can change not just the location of the roots, i.e., the IRRS but also the number of roots.
> - If you want to learn more, read up on bifurcations.
> - Reuse the example for multiple IRRs we had in class:
    - -1000, 3900, -5030, 2145
    
    
## Recall the PW function 
This has IRRs at 10%, 30% and 50%
```{r}

curve(-1000 + 3900/(1 + x) - 5030/(1 + x)^2 + 2145/(1 + x)^3, 0, .6, ylab = "PW", xlab="i"  )
curve(0 * x, 0, .6, add = TRUE)

```

## Watch the roots change
$A_0= -1002$ One root

```{r}

curve(-1002 + 3900/(1 + x) - 5030/(1 + x)^2 + 2145/(1 + x)^3, 0, .6, ylab = "PW", xlab="i"  )
curve(0 * x, 0, .6, add = TRUE)

```



## Watch the roots change
$A_0= -999$ Three roots

```{r}

curve(-999 + 3900/(1 + x) - 5030/(1 + x)^2 + 2145/(1 + x)^3, 0, .6, ylab = "PW", xlab="i"  )
curve(0 * x, 0, .6, add = TRUE)

```



## Watch the roots change
$A_0= -997$ One root again

```{r}

curve(-997 + 3900/(1 + x) - 5030/(1 + x)^2 + 2145/(1 + x)^3, 0, .6, ylab = "PW", xlab="i"  )
curve(0 * x, 0, .6, add = TRUE)

```

## IRR Problems
> - Your IRR sensitivity functions are not always continuous.
> - It requires a lot of time with clients to explain this.
> - Recomend talking your clents out of it.


# Priors for Sensitivity Analysis

## Finding a Good Range

> - In the examples above we just picked bounds.
> - Book gives some bad advice on how to pick the design points, bounds, in a sensitivity analysis, $\pm$ 20%.
    - Sometimes 20% is way too big, remember the intial cost in the IRR example?  4$ on a scale of 1000$
    - Sometimes 20% is way too small.  What is the smallest safety factor you have ever used? 1.25?

## Single Person

> - A few warnings.
    - This does not work with everyone.  They have to be reasonably numeric.
    - They have to be a real expert, with real opinions, real experience with data.
    - It is ok, if they need time, have to make some calculations or want to look a few things up.
    
> - Three questions for each parameter
    - What is your best guess?
    - Largest value that you are 90% sure the value is below?
    - Smallest value that you are 90% sure the value is above?  
    - Basically, what are your 80% bounds.


## Allows a Spider graph.
> - Horizontal axis shows percent difference from best guess.
> - Vertical shows the investment criteria of interest.

## What to watch for?

> - Parameter that cause a decision, sign, change.
    - Can turn a good idea into a bad one without more research
> - High sensitivity parameters, high slope.
    - Your expert may be more certain than they should be and should be consulted more about that parameter.
> - Low sensitivity parameters, low slope.
    - No more time should be spent on these.
    - Unless, your job is devil's advocate.

# Multi-Person

## Feasible

You have many choices:

> - Ask everyone for their best guess for each parameter:
    - Leads to Monte Carlo Simulations.
    - Captures correlations between beliefs in parameters

> - Delphi Survey:
    - Asks not just for numbers, but why you choose the number.
    - Monte Carlo Simulations


## Possible but difficult

> - Ask everyone for the best guess and 80% bounds:
    - Beyond scope of course.
    - Welcome again to Baysian land.
    
> - Ask everyone for joint distributions:
    - Hard to to do.
    - Goes Bayesian again.
    - Never had a client that could do it.
    - I have trouble doing it.

## Joint Distributions

<!-- Point out that it is easier with more than one and that I never had a client that could do a joint -->


## Monte Carlo Simulations
